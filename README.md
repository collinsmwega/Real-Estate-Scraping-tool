# Real-Estate-Scraping-tool
 Google Apps Script project for scraping real estate data from a website and writing it to a Google Sheet. The project includes a function scrapeRealEstateDataHybridApproach() that fetches HTML content from a specified URL, extracts property names and descriptions using regular expressions, combines the matches, and then writes the data to a Google Sheet.

Key features of the project include:

    1.Web scraping functionality using Google Apps Script's UrlFetchApp and regular expressions.
    2.Handling of HTML content to extract specific information (property names and descriptions).
    3.Logging using Logger.log() to provide information about the scraping process, including error messages if no matches are found or no data is available to write to the sheet.

The project provides a basic template for scraping real estate data from a website and can be extended or modified to suit specific needs or to scrape data from different websites.
